		<h1>Hi, I'm Matt Richards</h1>
		<p class="intro">A seasoned product designer with 15+ years crafting and launching innovative websites, products, and businesses.</p>

			<AccordionItem
				header="My background"
			>
				<p>I started my career as a full-time designer in 2008, working my way from a marketing web designer to product UX/UI designer within a few years. Since 2016, I've spearheaded design teams in remote and in-person settings, where I've typically mentored and hired one or two junior designers.</p>
				<p>Working closely with product and engineering teams, I've steered the creation of SaaS products, built robust design systems, and contributed in building a culture where design is valued and designers can ship their best work.</p>
				<p>I've worked in esports, physical security, and health insurance industries. My approach involves developing user-friendly, visually appealing products guided by a research-first methodology, refining designs based on continuous user feedback.</p>
				<p>My design process emphasizes communication, transparency, and an open exchange of ideas. I personally enjoy working alongside designers to bring their creative vision alongside business and technical leaders, validating ideas and solutions through research, and working together to craft feasible, user-friendly products. Finding the common ground between business and user goals is a product win/win, and always an exciting challenge to embrace.</p>

			<h3>Website is still a work-in-progress</h3>
			<p class="secondary">I'm developing this website using <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a>, which has meant rolling up the sleeves to learn more about Javascript and frontend development.</p>

			<p class="secondary">I'm still working on a few more pages, adding a dark mode, and polishing the experience further. I'll be adding a blog that goes over how I developed this site shortly, it's pretty cool how it all works.</p>
