			<h2>I redesigned two products, built a design system, mentored two designers, and lead the design team at Employee Navigator.</h2>

			<h3>Our products deliver benefits to over 13,000,000 employees working at 150,000 businesses across the United States. With a 97% customer satisfaction rating, our customers are highly engaged in shaping the best-in-class user experience for benefits administration.</h3>
			<h3>As a design generalist, I lead design efforts across the marketing, product, and engineering teams. I’m responsible for Employee Navigator’s brand, design team, design process, and the overall product experience. I delivered grounded and feasible solutions by working closely with developers, stakeholders, and the product team. I enjoy working closely with users to understand their needs, using real input and observations to shape and inform our outputs.</h3>
