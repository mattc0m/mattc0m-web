# I redesigned two products, built a design system, mentored two designers, and led the design team at Employee Navigator.

Our products deliver benefits to over 13,000,000 employees working at 150,000 businesses across the United States. With a 97% customer satisfaction rating, our customers are highly engaged in shaping the best-in-class user experience for benefit administrators across the United States.

As a design generalist, I lead design efforts across the marketing, product, and engineering teams. I’m responsible for Employee Navigator’s brand, design team, design process, and the overall product experience. I delivered grounded and feasible solutions by working closely with developers, stakeholders, and the product team. I enjoy working closely with users to understand their needs, using real input and observations to shape and inform our outputs.

## Managed UX Research

Building a successful digital product requires you continually learn from your users. By utilizing UX research, we’re able to identify the root cause and build workflows, interactions, and experiences that our customers love, all before writing a single line of code.

- Created EN First Look, a research program that allowed our users to opt-in for beta tests & UX product research sessions. Served as an internal CRM for research participants. Both users and PMs loved this program. Based on [Gitlab First Look](https://about.gitlab.com/community/gitlab-first-look/).
- Shared resources, best practices, and templates with product team. Conducted hands-on learning sessions and continually advocated for informing design decisions with user research.
- Regularly conducted & shared user research findings with product team.
