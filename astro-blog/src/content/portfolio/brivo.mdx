# I designed the product, mobile app, a design system, and lead the design team while at Brivo.

Brivo develops cloud-based access control software. It allows small businesses and enterprise security teams to remotely manage their devices, control door access, provision and sync credentials, monitor and track security events, and more. The platform can further be automated by integrated with existing identity providers, like Azure, Google, or Okta.

As Brivo’s first lead product designer, I worked closely with the product team to establish a culture and process to ship high-quality, well-researched design solutions. I led a small, two-person design team who created design solutions for all our web and mobile products.

Our team, product, and engineering worked closely to build a multi-platform design system, shipped 20+ major product features, and completely redesigned the two core products: Brivo Access and Brivo Mobile Pass.

Brivo Access is a unified platform for access control, user management, live event &  video monitoring, and more. Whether securing a single door or hundreds across dozens of locations, the software allows small businesses and enterprises to manage their physical spaces, control access, and quickly respond to incidents.

## Brivo Mobile Pass

The flagship product, Brivo Access allows small business owners or security teams to manage on-site devices, manage users and credentials, monitor live events and video, and otherwise manage security at scale.

- Led a three-month design sprint where product, design, and engineering teams worked closely to introduce Magic Button, alongside a major UI redesign.
- My role was to navigate the product and engineering teams through the design process, validate our proposed solutions with user research, and to tie all components to our existing design system.

## Brivo One

Developed a series of patterns and components that could be used by designers or developers. Created and maintained 30+ synced Figma & Vue-based Storybook components by collaborating with frontend engineers.

- We maintained foundational systems (color, icons, typography, etc.), implemented design tokens, and developed a series of reusable patterns (for tables, forms, sidebars, etc.).
- Created linked Figma libraries for all marketing and product design work.
- The goal was to give a shared language and more collaborative workflows for designers & developers.

## Managed UX Research

Building a successful digital product requires you continually learn from your users. By utilizing UX research, we’re able to identify the root cause and build workflows, interactions, and experiences that our customers love, all before writing a single line of code.

- Created EN First Look, a research program that allowed our users to opt-in for beta tests & UX product research sessions. Served as an internal CRM for research participants. Both users and PMs loved this program. Based on [Gitlab First Look](https://about.gitlab.com/community/gitlab-first-look/).
- Shared resources, best practices, and templates with product team. Conducted hands-on learning sessions and continually advocated for informing design decisions with user research.
- Regularly conducted & shared user research findings with product team.
